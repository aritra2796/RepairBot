# 👋 Hi, I'm Aritra!

I'm an aspiring software developer passionate about building intelligent, user-friendly software — especially with Python, AI, and interactive GUIs. I thrive on solving real-world problems through code and love iterating fast to make things better.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 🤖 **RepairBot** — A chatbot built with Panel and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo to automate mobile repair appointments. It handles diagnostics, scheduling, and feedback collection with a friendly UX.  To use this chatbot you need to setup kernel and use your own API key from OpenAI.
- 🧠 **Prompt Engineering Experiments** — Exploring how different system prompts and personas affect chatbot behavior and user experience.
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboards** — Using Panel and Python to build clean, responsive interfaces for data-driven applications.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- **Languages**: Python (proficient), HTML/CSS (basic)
- **Libraries**: Panel, OpenAI API, Pandas, NumPy
- **Strengths**: Debugging, GUI design, prompt tuning, iterative development
- **Mindset**: Persistent, solution-oriented, and always learning

## 💡 Interests

- Building AI-powered chatbots and assistants
- Designing intuitive user interfaces
- Exploring large language models and their practical applications
- Improving UX through thoughtful design and feedback loops
